            Enable or disable the idle inhibitor. When enabled the system will not
            suspend or hibernate when the screen is locked.
            The inhibitor lock is created via LoginD and way-shell expects the
            idle daemon to integrate with this service as well to understand
            ide locks.

            <default>false</default>
            <summary>Whether to focus workspaces that are set to urgent</summary>
            <description>
            Way-Shell will automatically focus workspaces which become urgent
            when this configuration is set to true.

            Workspaces are marked urgent when an application requests to be
            focused. This typically occurs when the app first opens and when
            the app requests focus.

            In practice, enabling this setting provides a more traditional feel
            when launching apps or clicking notifications, as Way-Shell informs
            the window manager to focus the app generating these events.

            <description>
            This is passed as the `format` argument to g_date_time_format when rendering the clock
            in the panel.
            Note that the clock only ticks every minute, so precise specifiers such as %S are
            useless.
            Way-Shell must be restarted for changes to take effect.
